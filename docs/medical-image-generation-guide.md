- `microscope` - High-end digital microscope
- `otoscope` - Premium digital otoscope
- `consultation_tool` - Advanced hair analysis device
- `hair_analyzer` - Sophisticated hair follicle analysis system

**Available Styles:**
- `apple_minimal` - Clean white background, soft studio lighting, minimalist aesthetic
- `professional_studio` - Professional studio lighting setup, commercial photography
- `clinical_clean` - Clinical white environment, sterile medical setting

**API Usage:**
```bash
# Generate individual images
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate-medical-images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "deviceType": "dermoscope",
    "style": "apple_minimal",
    "size": "1024x1024",
    "quantity": 1
  }'

# Generate complete hair restoration set
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate-hair-restoration-set \

## üîß Implementation in Your Project

### Using Generated Images
1. **Generate images** via the `/image-generator` page
2. **Download** the high-resolution versions
3. **Save** to your `public/images/medical/` directory
4. **Import** in your components:
```tsx
import dermoscopeImage from "@/assets/dermoscope-apple-style.jpg";
```

### Optimizing for Web
1. **Compress** images using tools like TinyPNG
2. **Create WebP versions** for modern browsers
3. **Implement lazy loading** for better performance
4. **Use responsive images** with different sizes

### Integration with Treatment Cards
The generated images work perfectly with your existing `FueStyleTreatmentCard` component:

```tsx
<FueStyleTreatmentCard
  title="Hair Analysis"
  description="Advanced digital analysis of hair follicles"
  image={generatedHairAnalyzerImage}
  learnMoreContent="Detailed analysis information..."
/>
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- **Avoid** medical terminology that might trigger AI content filters
- **Use** "medical device" instead of "surgical instrument"
- **Focus** on equipment rather than procedures
- **Emphasize** professional, clinical environments

### Quality Assurance
- **Test** generated images in your actual design
- **Verify** they match your brand aesthetic
- **Check** resolution and clarity at different sizes
- **Ensure** consistent lighting and style across all images

### Legal Considerations
- **AI-generated** images are generally copyright-free
- **Stock photos** require proper licensing
- **Professional photos** may need model releases
- **Always** verify usage rights before implementation

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. **Visit** `/image-generator` on your website
2. **Select** device type and Apple minimal style
3. **Generate** images for each treatment section
4. **Download** and optimize for web use
5. **Replace** placeholder images in your components
6. **Test** the final implementation
